cformsII is the most customizable, flexible & powerful ajax supporting contact form plugin (& comment form)!

== Description ==

This is a fork of cformsII, a highly customizable, flexible and powerful form builder plugin, covering a variety of use cases and features from attachments to multi form management, you can even have multiple forms on the same page!

The original author does not seem to further develop the plugin. This fork is an effort to keep it up to date.
If you want to use non-GPL versions older than 10.2, you can [browse the original Trac](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/cforms/).
If you want to use plugin versions older than 14.6.3, you should rename the directory containing the plugin from "cforms2" to "cforms".

= Credits =

Some icons are based on the wonderful set of Jan Kovařík: [glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com).

Oliver, the original author, believes in good karma, so it is up to you to activate the link attribution on the global settings page. Thanks for the consideration.

== Installation ==

= Installing the plugin =

You can install the plugin via Wordpress Dashboard. It should show up by searching
for cforms2. If this does not work for you, there should be an option to upload a
[zip file](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/cforms2.zip).

If you want to install manually, please upload the complete plugin folder "cforms2",
contained in the zip file, to your WP plugin directory!

= Upgrading the plugin =

If you want to upgrade from the original cformsII from deliciousdays.com, please
upgrade to the original version 14.6 first, make sure you upgraded your settings and
backup your database. Then deactivate the original plugin and install this fork.

If you want to delete the original version, make sure you do not delete your upload
directory.

= Did you modify any cforms theme (CSS) files, images etc? =

Create a custom folder under your WP plugin directory & call it "cforms-custom". Move
all your custom files into it. This folder will protect your changes going forward.

Also note that it is always advisable to make or keep a backup of your
current plugin directory just in case you need to revert back to a
previous release!

== Localization ==

If your language is set correctly the language file in the ____Plugin_Localization directory should be picked up immediately.

If there is a language file available, but not included in the standard distribution, please put the cforms-*.mo file in the wp-content/languages/plugins directory.

You can find a list of the [translations for the original cforms version](http://www.deliciousdays.com/cforms-plugin/).

If you would like to contribute a new language file, please [file a ticket](https://github.com/bgermann/cforms2/issues/new) with the translation file attached.
It has to be GPL licensed. If an available translation on the original website is not GPL licensed,
you must not redistribute it as long as it is not your translation.


== Donations ==

This fork is originally developed for the website of [tatkräftig](http://tatkraeftig.org) (only German), a German charitable organization that encourages and supports people in social engagement.
If you can afford it, please consider [making a donation](https://www.betterplace.org/organisations/tatkraeftig/donations/new) to support that organization and further development.

The original author who developed cforms until 2012 also has a [donation page](http://www.deliciousdays.com/cforms-donation).


== Roadmap ==

Some things are to be done:

* filter user input
* make attachments download support directories that are not exported via HTTP
* [support for Subscribe to Comments Reloaded](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/suggestion-support-subscribe-to-comments-reloaded)
* long term: refactoring with object oriented approach
